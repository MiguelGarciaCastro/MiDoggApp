# BrewMap 3.0
## Decription
The pandemic is finally over, your friends are all vaccinated and it’s time to grab some drinks at your local pubs. Just one brewery isn’t going to cut it - you want to do a full pubcrawl to celebrate the momentous occasion. What is close by? Where should we go first, second, third?

BrewMap is here to help! 

With our updated changes to BrewMap 3.0, you can login and share your experiences or explore other pubcrawl adventures on our community blog so you’re always connected with other pub-crawlers.
