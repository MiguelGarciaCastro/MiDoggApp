## Description
Sometimes, it's hard to figure out where you should take your dog for an outing. Which places and activities are dog-friendly? What do other dog handlers have to say about these dog-friendly places and activities near you?

MiDogApp is here to help! 

With MiDogApp, Michiganders can login and share experiences or explore other dog-friendly adventures on our community blog so theyâ€™re always connected with other dogs and their humans.

## Technologies Used
