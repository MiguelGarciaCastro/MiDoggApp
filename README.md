## Description
Sometimes, it's hard to figure out where you should take your dog for an outing. Which places are dog-friendly? What do other dog handlers have to say about these dog friendly places near you?

My Dog's App is here to help! 

With My Dog's App, you can login and share your experiences or explore other dog-friendly adventures on our community blog so youâ€™re always connected with other dogs and their humans.
