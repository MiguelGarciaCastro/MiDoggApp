## Description
Sometimes, it's hard to figure out where you should take your dog for an outing. Which places and activities are dog-friendly? What do other dog handlers have to say about these dog-friendly places and activities near you?

MiDoggApp is here to help! 

With MiDoggApp, you can login and share your experiences or explore other dog-friendly adventures on our community blog so youâ€™re always connected with other dogs and their humans.
